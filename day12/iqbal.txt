Iqbal (1817â€“1898), a prominent figure in 19th-century India, was a visionary social reformer, educator, and Muslim intellectual. Born in Delhi during the declining years of the Mughal Empire, Sir Syed witnessed a period marked by socio-political upheavals and educational stagnation within the Muslim community. Recognizing the importance of education for social progress, he founded the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College in Aligarh in 1875, which later evolved into the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). Sir Syed's educational reforms aimed at integrating modern Western scientific knowledge with traditional Islamic studies, fostering a synthesis that empowered Muslims to navigate the challenges of a changing world.
